# Abul Khoyer

Full Stack Engineer with a decade of experience in the web industry, bringing a diverse perspective from various roles. I started my career by converting PSDs into HTML and WordPress themes and then spent 5 years in technical support. My background includes significant experience with PHP and WordPress, but my passion has always been JavaScript and its ecosystem. Outside of office hours, I’ve dedicated much of my career to exploring JavaScript, and now I am fully immersed in it.
